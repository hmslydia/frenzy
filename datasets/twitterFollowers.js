Having engaging interactions with your existing followers also helps you leverage your extended social network in order to become visible to (and hopefully appealing to) the followers of your followers, as well as those people who have friends or followers in common with you.",

In other words, for many Twitter users, Twitter is a social network made up mostly of connections between virtual strangers and weak acquaintances rather than very good friends.  For these kinds of ties, details about the mundane minutiae of your everyday personal life (like what you ate for breakfast, the outcome of your daughter's soccer game, etc.) are much less attractive than timely or novel bits of news.",

On the other hand, hashtags are more difficult to read, especially when the tag contains more than a single word (e.g., #occupywallstreet, #libyafeb17).  So when you combine the readability issue with the fact that it is sometimes tempting to #spam #with #hashtags (i.e., over-tagging a single Tweet), then it is no wonder that many micro-bloggers feel that excessive #hastagsareannoying.",

Again, in the absence of face-to-face interactions, it's about sending the signals that indicate you are a real person with real interests.  Having a personalized photo, something about your geographic location, and listing a website are helpful. Your profile description should also indicate what it is you will likely be tweeting about -- the richer the details in your description, the better the results for attracting new followers.",
