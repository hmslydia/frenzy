All full papers accepted at this first conference will be published as AAAI archival proceedings in the AAAI digital library. While we encourage visionary and forward-looking papers, please only submit your best novel work; the paper track will not accept work recently published or soon to be published in another conference or journal. However, to encourage exchange of ideas, such work can be submitted to the non-archival poster and demo track. For submissions of this kind, the authors should include the venue of previous or concurrent publication.",
