If we answer this, then maybe it would help non-profit organizations (or advertising and marketing groups within companies) have more effective social media communication strategies. Or, maybe it would help the developers of social media technologies design their own systems to better address the needs and desires of their users. Or, maybe we'll just help current Twitter users be more attractive to potential new followers",
